## 🏗️ Demo Architecture

This tutorial demonstrates a multi-agent architecture where:
- **Specialized agents** handle specific areas within dedicated business domains (CRM, ERP, HR, etc.)
- **Agent Network** orchestrate and coordinate multiple specialized agents within their responsible domain
- **AI engines** (OpenAI, Einstein AI, Agentforce) power intelligent decision-making
- **MCP servers** provide standardized tool access for agents

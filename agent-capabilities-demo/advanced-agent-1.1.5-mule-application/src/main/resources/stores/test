The early hype around \ngenerative AI gave way to more pragmatic, use case-driven applications where \nthese technologies are poised to deliver truly groundbreaking innovation, \nincluding the emergence of autonomous agents.\n\nEarly AI use cases have already led to some incredible achievements — from  \nfaster customer response times to greater operational efficiency and better  \ndigital experiences, we are only starting to capitalize on what’s possible with AI.\n\nAs we move ahead in 2025, CxOs will be looking to solidify these early  \ngains and take their use of AI even further, to drive change that reshapes  \nentire industries.\n\nIn this report, our goal is to bring together insights that will help organizations  \nto pre-empt these changes, enabling leaders to plan ahead and maximize their \nadvantage from AI in 2025.\n\nThese seven key forces are already at work within MuleSoft, shaping the future \nvision for our platform and ensuring we’re ready to support our

building out and harnessing the power of their \nautonomous agents, organizations will need to heed  \nthe mistakes of the past. According to Frost \u0026 Sullivan,  \nthe top frustrations users currently have with virtual \nagents include poor error recovery (34%), slow resolution  \n(33%), and technical difficulty (33%).\n\nPoor integration is the common theme behind all of  \nthese challenges. If agents are unable to access the data  \nand capabilities they need to understand user queries,\n\nfind a solution, and resolve it for them, their impact  \nis severely limited.\n\nIn fact, 95% of IT leaders claim integration issues  \nare a key factor that impedes AI adoption.\n\nSuccessful autonomous AI agents will rely on organizations’ \nability to feed in as much data and context as possible  \nto ensure the responses being automated are the correct \nones. However, they also need to ensure that they are \nfeeding in the right data.\n\nThe reason so many AI projects have failed to date is that \nthey are too broad and generic — not grounded enough  \nin

ARCHITECTURES WILL DEMAND MORE ROBUST GOVERNANCE PRACTICES\n\nAs autonomous, multi-agent architectures begin to proliferate across global \nenterprises — streamlining workflows, reducing human error, and boosting  \nproductivity — organizations will need to build in more robust governance  \nchecks to maintain their security posture.\n\nThe surge in demand for AI capabilities will exacerbate the problem of API and  \nagent sprawl, which occurs when different teams and departments build integrations \nand automations without any centralized management or coordination. Already,  \nan estimated quarter of APIs are ungoverned.\n\nIf organizations don’t gain sufficient visibility and control, APIs and the autonomous \nagents they integrate could be successfully targeted by threat actors, who view them  \nas a gateway to sensitive enterprise and customer data.\n\nSome 60% of IT and security practitioners say their organizations have had  \nat least one data breach due to API exploitation, according to a 2023 study  \nfrom the Ponemon Institute and Traceable.\n\nThe problem is only expected to become more widespread as multi-agent \narchitectures expand.

securely connecting to each other and enterprise  \ndata sources, and automating processes safely.\n\nThey will increasingly rely on platforms that give them built-in guardrails, which  \ncan mask sensitive data types such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  \nand payment card details, before responding to AI prompts from third-party  \nLLMs and autonomous agents.\n\nAs these

to enhance \nefficiency, cut operational costs, and reduce manual toil by up to two hours  \nfor each employee per week in the IT department alone.\n\nThese benefits have driven a growing interest in RPA. In fact, we could see near-\nuniversal adoption of the technology by 2028, according to Deloitte.\n\nIn 2025, organizations will evolve their use of RPA technology to reduce the need  \nfor humans at every stage of the process.

this way, autonomous agents will help to extend the lifespan of legacy systems,  \nby acting as a quasi-API between the system and the rest of the world.\n\nAs they become more context-aware and authoritative, autonomous agents  \nwill gradually reduce their dependence on traditional RPA for automating legacy \nsystems — first by building smaller agents to carry out more specialized tasks.\n\n14\n\n87%\n\nSalesforce: 87% of IT leaders expect \nmore investment in automation at their \norganizations over the next 18 months.\n\nhttps://www.mulesoft.com/ty/report/connectivity-benchmark\nhttps://www2.deloitte.com/ro/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/deloitte-global-rpa-survey.html\nhttps://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-it/\n\nAgents will eventually become fully integrated into business operations, able  \nto automate more and more — including a full range of API integration tasks  \nthat enhance their capabilities even further.\n\nThese could include establishing new API connections between systems,  \noptimizing API performance, monitoring security threats, handling user  \ninteractions, and providing insights into usage trends.\n\nBeyond API integration, agents could be used to automate code generation \nand execution, governance policy enforcement, and coordination of enterprise \nworkflows, among other

85% of IT leaders say \n AI has increased developer productivity\n\nin their organization.\n\n85%\n\nHowever, questions remain around exactly how AI will transform the workforce.  \nThe jury is still out on the extent to which workers will be empowered to do more,  \nand how central they will remain to their traditional roles.\n\nThe answers to these questions will vary greatly depending on the function that \nthe department or employee performs. The role of the developer is set to change \ndramatically. Whereas before they would build an API, and then connect it with an \napplication to perform a function, it’s now possible to create the API as a reusable \nasset that an autonomous agent can build on.\n\nIn this new way of working, an AI agent will discover the API’s capabilities, understand \nthe context, and use it to orchestrate a solution for a business need. This shift will \nfundamentally change the way that software is developed.\n\nIn customer service, things are continuing to change quickly, too. AI is performing \ntime-consuming tasks like answering basic questions via 24/7 self-service portals \nand chatbots, freeing human agents to focus on more strategic priorities like building \ncustomer relationships.\n\nThis is a great example of how autonomous AI agents will complement, rather  \nthan compete with employees.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"/Applications/AnypointStudio721.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/org.mule.tooling.server.4.9.ee_7.21.0.202509011927/mule/apps/advanced-agent-1.1.5-mule-application","index":"14","file_name":"report-top-digital-transformation-trends-2025.pdf.pdf"}}}},{"id":"ffd0e14f-b67f-4e99-aada-a5ba9ef3687d","embedding":{"vector":[-0.11356751,-0.06092218,0.0068034376,0.007526709,-0.023799201,0.014360817,0.0020043864,-0.0012545362,-0.05816408,-0.12984909,-0.0123232575,0.094736524,0.022932108,0.00902782,0.06869546,0.022425763,0.13910681,0.009443062,-0.046352327,-0.13250878,-0.06648882,0.004973059,-0.067410134,-0.021550994,-0.025575997,-0.020136084,-0.013146365,-0.05896501,-0.042577926,-0.04084664,0.02060634,-0.0066187256,0.04493373,0.037219986,-0.0036568583,0.0048171254,-0.057846695,0.035812017,0.08685883,-0.04232043,-0.015509334,-0.08099702,-0.0794011,-0.0046035475,0.026692772,-0.003983442,0.016212342,-0.008094374,0.021082548,0.086616494,-0.08672817,-0.018304873,0.09027814,0.005960584,-0.079955555,0.06900859,0.0137169985,-0.012579491,-0.020612806,0.044597875,0.05572093,-0.037780467,0.06799388,0.024072614,0.038646,-0.051309954,-0.08012473,-0.032762952,-0.041726664,-0.08280083,0.0061703287,0.025746495,-0.023215856,-0.007762938,0.034107696,-0.014137105,-0.033273276,-0.022847606,0.11006827,-0.046927724,-0.051593274,-0.031661615,0.029818984,0.1186491,-0.08695906,0.0012961355,0.035112042,-0.048985727,-0.02481397,9.424303E-4,0.011016029,-0.021664536,-0.0040840507,-0.0748265,0.025670635,0.028286133,0.00744178,-0.019858548,-0.048271954,3.4954218E-4,-0.01473619,-0.0056607435,0.004095753,-0.033882976,-0.040204514,0.04171634,0.069240205,0.021043539,0.038498864,-0.031484034,0.011289948,-0.030127492,-0.0036368337,-0.04557803,0.045181524,0.010024182,-0.020600174,0.0856349,-0.014489262,0.1129645,-0.010007316,0.01266537,-0.016697844,0.008232168,0.03449955,0.08737146,0.003688187,5.6415765E-33,-0.04329086,0.07403852,0.034480322,-0.026527695,0.063030906,-0.093833774,0.008310138,0.030909218,-0.021630552,-0.04065641,-0.15742634,0.091348246,0.01854149,0.05532055,-0.019227741,0.022819927,-0.0455663,0.06213075,-0.0059286933,-0.03615637,0.06594934,-0.016449848,-0.040402018,0.026318757,0.0057606148,0.015468318,0.043449126,0.016550737,0.09929428,0.0037245224,-0.020230226,0.06016291,-0.039048154,0.08587341,-0.03867792,0.009103055,-0.11256633,-0.05218584,0.012012703,0.07150905,-0.037486233,0.056974955,0.062825456,-0.06183325,-0.027647926,-0.02947593,0.025616378,0.040518705,-0.014649182,0.05436521,0.024164215,0.07344371,0.020877652,0.04124792,0.03246238,0.011662736,0.05200028,0.0118797235,0.074619286,-0.018992838,0.0071092825,-0.05937687,-0.042616844,0.09552241,0.038416915,0.0076168273,0.11356754,-0.001664423,0.06927805,0.06453684,0.008061753,0.08478863,0.019640585,-0.025712296,-0.03460594,-0.018725988,0.012591224,-0.057946786,0.02730158,-0.012470637,-0.018301835,0.0019236619,0.057091482,-0.047617503,0.12489871,-0.009538007,0.02411619,-0.06641807,0.0064162095,0.11056735,0.02008905,0.044415846,-0.06739052,0.150248,0.0061935703,-3.6697824E-33,-0.0016816267,-0.021853302,-0.04213519,0.044505667,0.06586842,-0.015138904,0.0021760575,-0.034216028,-0.0013889271,0.027481124,-0.04731979,0.01787074,0.023012036,-0.013398155,-0.0480068,-0.022425141,0.03045343,-0.045872997,-0.021654688,-0.022870058,0.063112415,0.011795757,-0.018524615,0.008267936,0.08232344,-0.006463668,-0.08417565,0.019839363,-0.014044955,-0.014178435,-0.008696621,-0.0063336035,-0.008556683,-0.041121498,0.05612946,0.02237376,-0.042573135,0.019289011,0.01245331,0.04158031,0.051569264,-0.120179676,-0.08121339,-0.07762935,-0.011929332,-0.006942693,-0.07418793,-0.023175206,-0.0645717,0.019072456,-0.004719146,0.015161112,-0.08102218,-0.016811887,-0.06513139,-8.5078576E-4,0.07425869,-0.007346317,-0.06166544,0.028358659,-0.029619314,-0.05191307,0.13137522,0.016601183,-0.0012987311,-0.074063554,0.06163747,0.022200098,-0.038856953,-3.6932618E-4,0.07394184,-0.08719152,-0.01700015,0.057814937,-0.079865955,-0.02119322,0.04664194,-0.06976718,-0.026130708,-0.042560786,-0.05800648,0.0035637594,0.058054492,-0.0036496015,0.04117034,0.0594855,-0.0020373634,-1.3991422E-4,-0.0045994977,0.027012536,-0.039273657,-0.011296925,-0.086859345,-0.0035339878,-0.081794806,-5.3753787E-8,-0.022877516,0.011207228,0.018399136,0.023350818,0.007687052,-0.08722086,-0.021041801,0.08292196,0.011918692,0.075896166,0.03705523,-0.085546814,-3.8766515E-4,0.060025968,0.12678286,0.11448345,0.051470798,-0.005135972,-0.040030643,-0.05737158,0.06596452,0.044789918,-0.04435151,-0.0093803415,0.018512852,0.035677485,-0.058392946,0.025120808,-0.013476245,0.036991216,-0.024883373,0.017660553,0.043045495,-0.050629895,0.04991843,0.039368503,0.04180809,-0.032210156,-0.096102014,-0.06805176,0.018663485,0.08377831,-0.020749548,-0.058266524,0.10362513,-0.09165459,-0.016709981,-0.020398203,0.05405208,0.0114279,0.03171196,-0.0047731115,0.0305647,-0.02118169,0.11389336,-0.020290645,0.09376399,-0.099850

pandemic was the catalyst for the shift towards more flexible working patterns. \nMcKinsey claims that up to 25% of workforces in advanced economies could work \nfrom home 3–5 days per week. That’s 4–5 times more than they did pre-COVID.\n\nTo support this transition to a more flexible workplace, employees are becoming  \nmore reliant on a growing number of applications.\n\nGartner claims that 40% of digital workers are using more than the average number \nof applications (11) in their day-to-day roles.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the MuleSoft Connectivity Benchmark Report, organizations \nuse an average of 991 applications across the entire digital estate. This is simply not \nsustainable unless these applications are fully integrated, as silos add cost and complexity \nand erode productivity.\n\nAs they seek to break down the silos between applications, in 2025, organizations \nwill look towards super apps.\n\n23\n\nGartner: By 2027, over half of the global \npopulation will be using multiple super\n\napps on a daily

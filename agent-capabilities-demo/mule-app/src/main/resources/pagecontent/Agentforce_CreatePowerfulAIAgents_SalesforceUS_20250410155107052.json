Users can tap into existing tools like Flows, prompt templates, Apex, and APIs to configure their agent. Setup is simple: Create a job to be done by the agent by defining topics, giving natural language instructions for that topic, and creating a library of actions for it to choose from. Easily monitor an agent\u2019s plan of action and test its responses right in Agent Builder.\n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/img-agent-trailblazer-1c.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n  \n\n  ###   Atlas Reasoning Engine        \n\n   The [Atlas Reasoning Engine](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-is-a-reasoning-engine/atlas/) is the brain of Agentforce. Users can equip agents to respond naturally and adapt to situations so they're faster, more multi-turn, and more capable. Increase their accuracy with topics, which classify requests into a specific category with a defined scope and rules, including which actions an agent can and cannot take.\n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/img-agent-trailblazer-2c.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n  \n\n  ###   Trust & Guardrails        \n\n   With Agentforce, teams can use natural language topics and instructions to create guardrails for an agent, including when to escalate or hand off a task to a human. The [Einstein Trust Layer](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/trusted-ai/) enables Agentforce to use any LLM safely by ensuring that no Salesforce data is viewed or retained by 3rd-party model providers.\n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/img-agent-trailblazer-3c.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/img-agent-trailblazer-1c.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/img-agent-trailblazer-2c.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/img-agent-trailblazer-3c.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n       ## Only Agentforce brings together Humans + AI + Data + Actions\n\n    ###   Humans + AI        \n\n   The most effective use of AI agents is as partners to humans in the customer experience. Assistive agents can help employees in the flow of work by taking on time-consuming jobs so people can focus on high value tasks. [Autonomous agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/autonomous-agents/) perform certain tasks proactively and escalate to humans when necessary. For example: Agents can provide every new AE their own, personal sales coach that gives them feedback, offers guidance, and helps them be their best on the job.\n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/horizontal-container-one-up-humansplusaI.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n  \n\n  ###   Data        \n\n   Agents need the right data to work. With [Data Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/data/) and Tableau Semantics, you can create the most intelligent agents possible, because they have access to the right data and your unique business context for any employee or customer experience. Use any data in your organization with Agentforce, across all systems and sources. It\u2019s scalable, secure, and enterprise-grade thanks to Data Cloud and [Tableau](https://www.salesforce.com/analytics/). Without sacrificing security, your agents can be dynamic and knowledgeable about your business process and customers \u2014 and act accordingly.\n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/horizontal-container-one-up-data.webp.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n  \n\n  ###   Actions        \n\n   An AI agent that can\u2019t take meaningful action is just another bot. Agentforce agents take action across any system so you can complete work faster. They connect data to action by exposing [metadata](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-is-metadata/) about defined workflows and [AI automations](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-automation/). This is what makes them capable of high-value tasks. These may be actions taken on the employee's behalf. For example, these AI agents can help a sales rep draft an email to a customer, create a close plan, and kick off a 1:1 nurture cadence for the customer that includes all their upcoming marketing activities.\n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/horizontal-container-one-up-actions.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/horizontal-container-one-up-humansplusaI.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/horizontal-container-one-up-data.webp.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n   ![](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/09/horizontal-container-one-up-actions.webp?w=1024) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          \n\n    ## Agentforce Testing Center\n\n  Testing autonomous AI agents requires an approach that works for non-deterministic systems. With Testing Center, teams can use AI to generate hundreds of synthetic interactions, then run those tests automatically in parallel to see what topics and actions Agentforce chooses. From here, teams can iterate by adjusting instructions as needed \u2014 saving time that would have been lost on manually testing many different variations of a conversation. Testing Center can also evaluate agent guardrails at scale, determining if responses are contextually accurate and faithful.\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n      ![Agentblazer Characters](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/promotion-agentforce-agentblazer-2.webp?w=1020) \n\n   ## Join the Agentblazer community.\n\n  Connect with Agentblazers from around the world to skill up on AI, discover use cases, hear from product experts, and more.

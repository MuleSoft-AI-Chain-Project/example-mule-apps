# MCP Catalog & Playground Demo

## Overview

The **MCP Catalog & Playground** enables Mule MCP Developers to quickly test out the semantics of MCP Servers deployed to Cloudhub. Currently this demo playground doesn't support MCP Server Authentication, the purpose (for now) is to import freshly deployed MCP Servers into the playground catalog and test out the semantics in different modes. 

### Experimental Modes

This playground provides different experimental modes for MCP Servers from low level function callings to fully fledge agent mode.
